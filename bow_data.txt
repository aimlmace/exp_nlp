This is a one of the best apps acording to a bunch of people and I agree it has bombs eggs pigs TNT king pigs and realustic stuff
This is a pretty good version of the game for being free. There are LOTS of different levels to play. My kids enjoy it a lot too.
this is a really cool game. there are a bunch of levels and you can find golden eggs. super fun.
This is a silly game and can be frustrating, but lots of fun and definitely recommend just as a fun time.
This is a terrific game on any pad. Hrs of fun.  My grandkids love it. Great entertainment when waiting in long lines
This is a very entertaining game!  You don't have to be smart to play it.  I guess that's why I like it...it's easy and fun and that's what games are suppose to be.  Be warned: this game is highly addictive.
this is awesome and you don't need wi ti to play trust me. it is really fun and addicting. there are like hundred levels it is even free don't waste your money on the expensive one I mean seriously. get the app
this is awesome I bet no one even reads the reviews because they know this game is so good that they don't need to
This is basicly the free version but with ads. That's actually awesome!!!! It's addicting and free at the same time really. I'd reccomend it.
this is by far the best free app that is available anywhere. it has helped pass the time when nothing else would do. don't pass this one up. PS I hate this twenty word minimum!
This is definitely a great game.  I have to get my 6-year-old grand-nephew to teach me the tricks.  I have figured out some of them, but some configurations are tough to beat.
